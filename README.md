# Official Account of Trịnh Ngọc Các

Hi, I'm Ngọc Các. I am a Data Science graduate at the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City (UEH), and a Researcher at AAI Labs, a Lithuanian AI solutions company.

My focus is on research of practical AI applications. For me, AI research isn't about producing intelligent machines,
but about uncovering how we interpret and act upon raw information in everyday life.

I mainly take interest in fields like [**Computer Vision**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision) (object detection and motion estimation) and
[**Computer Audition**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_audition) (audio analysis and music information retrieval).
However, my experience in these fields is limited, so I am always looking for opportunities to join relevant projects.\
Please check out my pinned repositories for some of my past/present projects.

Although unskilled at mathematics, I also enjoy recreational maths. I sometimes do projects on fractals,
computer graphics or build search algorithms to solve puzzles. If you are interested, check out my latest ones:
- [Marching Squares](https://github.com/Ngoc-Cac/Marching-Squares): An algorithm on countour generation from a
    scalar field. In short, the contours are generated by interpolating lines using information form adjacent "cells".
- [Wave Function Collapse](https://github.com/Ngoc-Cac/Wave-Function-Collapse): This is better known as **Model synthesis**,
    which is used for procedural generation. The algorithm solves a constraint satisfaction problem modeled after the concept
    of superposition in quantum mechanics. The algorithm is famous for its application in terrain generation for video games.
- [Minesweeper Bot](https://github.com/Ngoc-Cac/minesweeping-bot): This is a tiny pet project where I build a basic algorithm
    for solving a Minesweeper board. The bot currently supports two common Minesweeper website.
