# Official Account of Trịnh Ngọc Các

Hi, I'm Ngọc Các. I'm currently a Data Science undergrad.\
I take interest in fields like **Computer Vision** (mainly with object detection and motion estimation) and **Computer Audition** (audio analysis, intrusment recognition and especially music generation).\
Although unskilled at mathematics, I also enjoy recreational maths. I sometimes do projects on fractals, cellular automata or build search algorithms to solve puzzles.
